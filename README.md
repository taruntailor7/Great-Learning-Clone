## Task

Our task is to create educational website using HTML CSS JS JSON SERVER.

## Making

I am a student of a Full Stack Web Development course offered by Masai School. During our construct week, I was assigned a task to create a pixel-perfect clone of Nifty official website. I was given a team of three excluding me. After some meetings and discussions, we started working on it and completed all the given tasks in 4 days.
